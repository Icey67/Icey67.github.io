        <h1>Welcome to <span style="color: cyan">Icey</span>'s Website</h1>
        <p>
            N<i style="color: cyan">ice</i> to see you here, I am
            <span style="color: cyan;">Icey</span><span style="color: #7100ff">6</span><span style="color: yellow">7</span>, often called
            <span style="color: cyan;">Icey</span>
            <br>
            I am quite the tech enthusiast, and I love to tinker with computers, occasionally coding too.
            <br>
            I currently indulge in C#, HTML/CSS and a bit of JavaScript, just because. That's why this page exists.
            <br>
            <i>well not all too willingly C#, that's being taught to me via my school.</i>
            <br>
            As you can see via the disclaimer up top; this is a work in progress, and will be for a while until I fully learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
            <br>
            This page will be a hub for my projects, social media (if any at all), and other cool things I find on the internet. (Oh and I supposedly blog too now.)
            <br>
            And I guess other funny things I find, like memes and whatnot.
            <br>
            Also, I'm copying some bits and pieces of code from <a href="https://leo.might-be.gay/" id="leo-link">another friends page</a> and eveee's/my old website because I can, even legally.

        <h1>More about <span style="color:cyan;">Icey</span><span style="color:#7100ff">6</span><span style="color:yellow">7</span></h1>
        <p>
            Oh, so you want to know more about myself?
            <br>
            Interesting, I guess I can humor you. Do not expect me to tell you my real name and anything else personal though.
            <br>
            So, as you may know, I am <span style="color:cyan;">Icey</span>. And I love to mess around with computers and in general, technology.
            <br>
            For instance, I used Linux a while back on my main PC, I do plan on doing that again eventually, though considering that it's in a relatively rough shape, that'll be hard.
            <br>
            I suppose you can classify me as an adolescent, though again, don't expect me to tell you my age; unless you know me personally.
            <br>
            Pronouns? Yeah, I guess I go by he/him, I jokingly put <span style="color:cyan;">ice</span>/<span style="color: cyan">ice</span>m on my Discord though, you can probably guess why. :P
            <br>
            Now I do not know what else I can tell you about myself, I'll do that later. <i>later meaning another time when I work on this site.</i>

        <h1>About this page</h1>
        <p>
            Well, as I've said before, this page exists via HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
            <br>
            Nothing else eventful about it, it's being hosted by our lord and saviour (maybe) <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>
            <br>
            I would want to host it myself with a custom domain and Cloudflare, <span style="font-family:'Fira Code', monospace">eveee00</span> offered to give me his domain <a href="https://eveee00.xyz" style="font-family:'Fira Code', monospace; color: white;">eveee00.xyz</a>
            <br>
            so it would be <span style="color: cyan">Icey</span><span style="color: #7100ff">6</span><span style="color:yellow">7</span>.<span style="font-family:'Fira Code', monospace;">eveee00.xyz</span>
            <br>
            Which (no offense eveee xd) would be a bit funky/weird
            <br>
            So that is undecided so far, besides it's currently not too possible for me, for reasons I shan't name. (shan't??)
