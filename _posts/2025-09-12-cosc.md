# Custom OS CRUSADE (COSC)

It started on September 3rd.

If I remember correctly, I was starting to get exceedingly tired of Windows. I had been using Windows 10 on my PC for a while, my PC's limitations were sickening under this OS.
<br>
Issues like unstable network, laggy games, relatively bad driver support, the software audio mixer glitching under heavy load and overall poor performance were driving me nuts.
<br>
I used Linux on this PC before, but switched back to Windows because of some weird issues I had (like some games overall not launching at all).
<br>
I was hesitant to install it again, but seeing my options as to sticking with a barely running Windows 10 install, or to bite the bullet and go ham again.

I decided for the latter.
<br>I copied most of my files as possible on to a smaller external drive (A 512GB hard drive single-handedly stored data from two 1TB drives \[not that I had much on them anyway]), ran <a href="https://rufus.ie/">Rufus</a> to make an endeavourOS installer.
<br>

Then after it installed, I noticed that the PCI Wi-Fi card stopped working, so I switched it out for my PCIe one, which worked flawlessly. <br>I was happy that the PCIe one finally worked again.
<br>
So I copied my files back, here have a photo of that! :P

Yes I copied them folder by folder, I didn't want to risk screwing over my home folder or user configuration or something. idk

<div class="music-section" data-ytid="KCaTaRrqk4E" data-tip="combining two unlikely musical scales - AZALI">ðŸŽµ</div>
After copying a f\*\*\*ton of files, I started installing stuff such as Steam, Discord <span style="font-size:15px; color:rgba(255,255,255,0.2);">(psst, i'm using vesktop, don't tell discord)</span> and... uhhh..
<br>f\*\*\*, I don't know what else I installed at the time, I created this blog post file on September 12th, and I'm currently writing this on the f\*\*\*ing 28th.
<br>soo... I think I also installed Flameshot, Easyeffects and Bottles?
<br>And I'm not even using Flameshot anymore because of some Wayland issue that makes it not work on my secondary monitor, and Spectacle works just fine after configuring it.
<br><span style="font-size:15px; color:rgba(255,255,255,0.2);">(and even now it doesn't even work at all because I apparently didn't give it permission to access the screens)</span>

Anyway, with <span style="font-family: 'Fira Code', monospace;">eveee00</span>'s microphone filter preset <span style="font-size:15px;color:rgba(255,255,255,0.2)">wherever he got THAT from<sub> that "wherever" is a real word??</sub></span>, I was able to get a pretty good sound out of my mic, and I was relatively happy with it.
<br>Too bad I can't do my trademark<sup>â„¢</sup> <span style="font-size:15px; color:rgba(255,255,255,0.2);">(oh yeah trademarks still look big in my font, even with \<sup>)</span> "bass boom"
<br>Now I would've added an audio clip of it, but it seems like I don't have one anymore, haha.. guess I did miss *some* files after all. :P <span style="font-size:15px; color:rgba(255,255,255,0.2);">(eugh, italics look weird in this font)</span>
<br>Anyway, I was pretty happy with how my mic sounded, and with some more help of <span style="font-family: 'Fira Code', monospace;">eveee00</span>, I was able to get it "inject" to all apps (meaning it would pipe the filtered audio to all apps that want to use the microphone).
<br>And then with a bit more tweaking and tweaking out with <span style="font-family: 'Fira Code', monospace;">eveee00</span>, I got Bluetooth working as well.
<div class="music-section" data-mute="true">ðŸ”‡</div>
Finally with ALL OF THAT DONE, I started playing R.E.P.O with <span style="font-family: 'Fira Code', monospace;">eveee00</span> and his friends, and it was a blast.
Now with all that done, I installed some more stuff such as Kdenlive, Obsidian, Prism Launcher.
<br>I would've rather installed DaVinci Resolve, but it seems like it doesn't support my CPU anymore, so I guess I'll stick with Kdenlive for now. <span style="font-size:15px; color:rgba(255,255,255,0.2);">(why doesn't it support my cpu on linux anymore? apparently because it needs a certain instruction set on there that windows didn't need ðŸ˜  )</span>
<br>And then a few days later, I installed Deep Rock Galactic, and played with a friend of mine, can't tell/remember if it ran better though.
