# Custom OS CRUSADE (COSC)
<sub>Created on {{ page.date | date: "%B %d, %Y; %H:%M" }}</sub>

It started on September 3rd.

If I remember correctly, I was starting to get exceedingly tired of Windows. I had been using Windows 10 on my PC for a while, my PC's limitations were sickening under this OS.
