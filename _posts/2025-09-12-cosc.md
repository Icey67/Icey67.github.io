# Custom OS CRUSADE (COSC)

It started on September 3rd.

If I remember correctly, I was starting to get exceedingly tired of Windows. I had been using Windows 10 on my PC for a while, my PC's limitations were sickening under this OS.
<br>
Issues like unstable network, laggy games, relatively bad driver support, the software audio mixer glitching under heavy load and overall poor performance were driving me nuts.
<br>
I used Linux on this PC before, but switched back to Windows because of some weird issues I had (like some games overall not launching at all).
<br>
I was hesitant to install it again, but seeing my options as to sticking with a barely running Windows 10 install, or to bite the bullet and go ham again.

So I did, I copied most of my files as possible on to a smaller external drive (A 512GB hard drive single-handedly stored data from 2x1TB drives \[not that I had much on them anyway]), ran <a href="https://rufus.ie/">Rufus</a> to make an endeavourOS installer.

Then after it installed, I noticed that the PCI Wi-Fi card stopped working, so I switched it out for my PCIe one, which worked flawlessly. I was happy that the PCIe one finally worked again.
